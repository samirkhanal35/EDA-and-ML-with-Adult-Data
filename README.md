# Income Prediction Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

<b>Abstract—As the title of the paper, the research is conducted to predict whether the persons’ income exceeds $50K/year or not. The input data about the different factors are collected from a given UCI dataset which is based on census data. The dataset is then processed through data cleaning, handling of missing values, Outlier removal, feature selection, data normalization, data visualization, and splitting of data into a training set and testing set. The training set is then fitted into Supervise Learning model, Gaussian Naïve Bayes model, and into the Unsupervised learning model, KMeans from scikit learn library. The Gaussian Naïve Bayes model is tested with the testing dataset, whereas the optimal number of clusters is calculated in KMeans<br/>

  <h2>Introduction</h2><br/>
  People of different ages with different educational backgrounds and different years of experience have different amounts of income. The amount of income is dependent on different factors. We can predict whether the persons’ income is greater than 50K or not based on different factors.
